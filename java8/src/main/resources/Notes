Java8 Features:
--------------
1. Lambda Expressions
2. Functional Interfaces
3. Streams API
4. Anonymous Innerclass Vs Lambda Expressions



4. Anonymous Innerclass Vs Lambda Expressions:
---------------------------------------------

Thread t = new Thread();

Thread t= new Thread() {
//Some statements
}; // Thread having child class with no name => i.e; anonymous inner class

--
Another ex:

Runnable r = new Runnable() {

//Some statements
}; // Runnable interface implemented child class with no name => i.e; anonymous inner class


----------
interface A {
  m1();
  m2();
}

--> Can I go for Lambda expression for above class..? No.
--> Can I go for Anonymous innner class for above class..? Yes.

============

Lambda expression != Anonymous inner class

If an interface with single abstract method then only we can go with Lambda Expressions.
